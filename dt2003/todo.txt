FX:

- interpolate abs pos		10a
- interpolate rel pos		11a
- interpolate abs tar	12a
- interpolate rel tar	13a
	- start (sine)				a=1
	- start (sine*)				a=2
	- start (linear)			a=3
	- start (linear*)			a=4
	- end						a=0

	* = exactly the same as the one without a star, except that if pitch or yaw are interpolated, they go counter-clockwise.


- use vector or polar		2ab
	a and b are both a 4-bit bitmask.
	leaving a bit at 0 means 'no change'.
	setting a bit to 1 in a means 'set column to vector'
	setting a bit to 1 in b means 'set column to polar'
	
	- abs pos		bit 1
	- rel pos		bit 2
	- abs tar		bit 3
	- rel tar		bit 4

	20f would set all columns to polars.
	280 after that would set 'abs tar' to vectors, leaving the others whatever they were.

	when bits are set in both a and b, b wins (so polars it is).


- tar relativity		3a?
	- to org				a=1
	- to pos				a=2


- set org				4ab
	- curpos->org			a=1
	- curtar->base			b=1


- shake						8?b
	- heaviness					b=0..f


- flash						9ab
	- duration					a=0..f
	- intensity					b=0..f











///OLD\\\
- use dir or tar			
	- dir					20?
	- tar					21a
		- rel to pos			a=0 
		- rel to org			a=1



- use vector or polar		2ab
	- abs pos		a=0
	- rel pos		a=1
	- abs tar		a=2
	- rel tar		a=4

	when specified, polar is used.

//	- use vector	b=0
//	- use polar		b=1

	when negative (-2ab) and a=>tar, tar is relative to origin, not position.
	a can be ORed together.
